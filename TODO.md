# TODO

* Error handling not working when connecting with invalid token
* Support web hooks too

* Optionally discard old (>5 sec) messages?
* Extract return values better for subscriptions, similar to what jsxapi does
* Support for device update events (check by changing location)


## Samples to include

* Keep track of whether a meeting room is occupied or not
* Call help desk (action button)
* Add a ui extension and macro (requires multiline data)
* Send a webex message if a device boots
